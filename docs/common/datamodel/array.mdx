### Deprecated

Growable Arrays are deprecated in Ditto 2.0, and will be out of maintenance in
Ditto 3.0, which means that you will not be able to syncronize them with the Big
Peer. Please use a [map](../datamodel/map) or [register](../datamodel/register) instead. 

If you're interested in this feature or need support migrating to a map or register, [please contact us](mailto:contact@ditto.live).
:::

Arrays are an ordered list of values. Arrays can contain all primitive
values as well as nested collection types like other Arrays or Maps.

* Push - upserts a value on to the end of an array 
* Pop - removes a value at the end of an array

<SnippetGroup
  name='array' 
/>

If two devices `push` this data, both devices will see `["Susan", "Susan"]`.

## When do I use a growable array?


### Text editing

For example, if two users are editing the same text box at the same time (or
concurrently), an array will automatically converge their edits into a single,
cohesive list of characters.

Device A:

```js
collection.upsert({
  id: 'abc123',
  text: ['i', ' ', 'l', 'o', 'v', 'e', ' ', 's', 'u', 's', 'h', 'i']
})
```

Device B:

```js
collection.upsert({
  id: 'abc123',
  text: ['i', ' ', 'l', 'o', 'v', 'e', ' ', 's', 'u', 's', 'h', 'i']
})
```

When these two devices synchronize, you will see the following document:

```json
{
  "id": "abc123",
  "text": "i love sushii love sushi"
}
```

You'd expect this result from a collaborative text editor; if two users type
into the same document textbox at the same time, you would want to preserve the
intent of the user and render all typed characters. 

For inserting characters and removing characters from an index in an array, see
the API reference for your language. 

### Immutable Logs

:::caution
If you're looking to create many documents to model a timeseries, do not
use arrays. Instead, see the [Timeseries API](/guides/http).
:::

You can also use the array for recording a log of immutable items within a
document. For example, you might want to use an array like this for reporting
errors about a particular document that isn't relevant for other documents
within a collection.


Device A:

```js
collection.upsert({
  id: 'abc123',
  log: []
})
```

You can use `push` to append new entries to the end of the list. This will be
consistent for all devices. 

Device A:

```js
collection.update(doc => {
  doc.log.push({
    time: '2:00pm', // your language's built-in date time library
    error: 'First error',
    deviceId: "device1"
  })
}
```

Device B:

```js
collection.update(doc => {
  doc.log.push({
    time: '2:05pm', // your language's built-in date time library
    error: 'Another error',
    deviceId: "device2"
  })
}
```

Concurrent `push` operations will be merged into a single ordered list. The
order between two concurrent `push` operations is deterministic after
syncronization, which means all devices will see the same order. 

```json
{
  "id": "abc123",
  "log": [
    {
      "time": "2:05pm",
      "error": "Another error",
      "deviceId": "device2"
    },
    {
      "time": "2:00pm",
      "error": "First error",
      "deviceId": "device1"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that all these items could be out of order, depending on if devices are
calling `push` while connected or disconnected from each other. 

### Mutable Items

:::caution
Putting objects into an array is an advanced feature and should be avoided
unless you really know what you're doing. We recommend that you use register
values inside an array.
:::

If you are still convinced that you need an array, but it isn't for text editing
or immutable items, **it is still probably better use a Map instead**.

Use these rules of thumb to prevent unexpected behavior in your application:

**Use `upsert` to initialize the array.**

```js
let susanId = people.upsert({
  name: "Susan",
  friends: []
})
```

**Use the `update` API to modify the array**

```js
people.update(doc => {
  doc.friends.push("John")
})
```

**Reference objects by their id**

This means that that objects can be modified concurrently. Otherwise, updates could be
lost or duplicated with concurrent `push` and `pop` operations.

```js
let johnId = people.upsert({
  name: "John",
  friends: []
})
people.findById(susanId).update(doc => {
  doc.friends.push(johnId)
})
```

**Watch out for duplicates**

You may want to ignore duplicate items with the same ID by turning your arrays into Sets within application code.

```js
let susan = people.findById(susanId)
let unique = Set(susan.friends)
render(unqiue)
```


## Querying 

For the following examples assume a document structure like:


```json
{
  "_id": "123abc",
  "books": [
    {
      "title": "Harry Potter",
      "authors": ["J. K. Rowling"]
    },
    {
      "title": "Lord of the Rings",
      "authors": ["J. R. R. Tolkien"]
    },
    {
      "title": "Game of Thrones",
      "authors": ["George R. R. Martin"]
    },
    {
      "title": "The Talisman",
      "authors": ["Stephen King", "Peter Straub"]
    }
  ],
  "tags": ["fantasy", "novel"],
  "scores": [12, 14]
}
```

Use `array[index]` to access a specific index of an array property. Let's say we have a document that looks like:

```js
// finds the first book property under "books" and checks for the "title" property
find("books[0].title == 'Harry Potter'")
```

Use `length(propertyPath)` to return an integer value that represents the size of the array

```js
// finds books that have at least 2 tags
find("length(tags) >= 2")
```

Use `sum(propertyPath)` to return a summation float that represents the sum of the array values

```js
// finds documents who have a sum of all their scores to be less than 10
find("sum(scores) < 10")
```

Use `array[? expression]` to return an array containing only the input array items that satisfy the expression.
  
Eg. `books[? length(authors) >= 2]` for the example document is `[{"title": "The Talisman", "authors": ["Stephen King", "Peter Straub"]}]`.

```js
// finds documents with books that have 2 or more authors
find("books[? length(authors) >= 2] != []")
```

Use `array[*].subpath` to collect a subpath of each input array item in the result array.

Eg. `books[*].authors[0]` for the example document is `["J. K. Rowling", "J. R. R. Tolkien", "George R. R. Martin", "Stephen King"]`

Eg. `books[*].authors` for the example document is `[["J. K. Rowling"], ["J. R. R. Tolkien"], ["George R. R. Martin"], ["Stephen King", "Peter Straub"]]`
  
```js
// finds documents with books whose first author is Stephen King 
find("contains('Stephen King', books[*].authors[0])")
```

Use `array[]` to flatten the input array by one level. Elements of the input array that are not arrays are pushed as-is to the result array.

Eg. `(books[*].authors)[]` for the example document is `["J. K. Rowling", "J. R. R. Tolkien", "George R. R. Martin", "Stephen King", "Peter Straub"]`

```js
// finds documents with books authored or co-authored by Stephen King
find("contains('Stephen King', (books[*].authors)[])")
```

## How it works

Elements are added to the array at a position. Where two element are inserted at
position four, after items `X`, the merge will use causal information from
the logical clock to decide which element gets the position, and which gets the
position + 1. The result is deterministic.

When elements of an array are updated, then the element merges as-per the merge
behaviour of the type at that position in the array.

Merging works in such a way that we never merge the element with a different
element, even if it moves. If some element's position has changed (due to
insertions or removes) at one device, we ensure to merge that element with it's
corresponding version in the other devices.

When an element is removed from the array, a tombstone is recorded, ensuring
that if there is an update concurrent with the remove the remove wins.
