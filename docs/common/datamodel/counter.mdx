Counter is a very special type that is specific to CRDTs. While they look like
the number type, they are geared towards building applications where various
different devices need to increment or decrement at the same time while
preserving consistency. The most common use cases are inventory or voting applications. 

Counters can be changed through a special method called increment which takes a
number to increment the counter by. If you wish to decrement the counter then
you can supply a negative number.

To create a counter, first insert a document with Counter. Once the value in the
document is a counter, you can proceed to increment or decrement the value. This
will preserve an accurate value whenever devices sync.

## When do I use a counter?

Let's look through a typical example for a counter: four flight attendants walk
through an airlane and record passenger meal orders. For each seat, they count the
number of cans ordered.  

First, the flight attendant selects the flight they are on. They then see an
interface with each seat in a list view. This might be retrieved by an external
API, or it could be internal to the app based on some known information about
each plane type.  

In a production application, each seat would have a few values that the
attendant can modify, but we will just focus on `name` and `orderedCount` in
this example. As each flight attendant is walking through the airplane,
their devices synchronize together to make sure that each customer only
received one meal. 

If we used a [register](../datamodel/register) here the value would alternate between the
latest updated value. Instead, a counter merges by taking the sum of each
attendant's value. If attendant A has sold 100, attendent B has sold 33, and
attendant C has sold 98, the value of the counter is 100 + 33 + 98 = 231.

Counters can be decremented too. A word of warning, there is nothing to stop a
counter from going negative. If the count is 1 and two attendants decrement the count by 1
concurrently, the result is -1.

### Code example

In this example, we will:

* Use `upsert` to ensure the document exists before interacting with it.
* Use `update` to increment the counter.

First, when the app loads we call `populateSeats()`, and then we
`renderSeatList()`. 

We want the flight attendants to be able to count orders, even if the app is
opened while offline. To ensure this, we locally populate all the known flights
with default data. This means the flight attendant can start collecting
information from scratch even while offline and if they have no connections to
other devices.

`MainViewController.swift` 
```swift
flightIds.forEach {
  try! collection.upsert([
      "_id": $0,
      "name": "Flight ABC123",
      "orderedCount": DittoCounter(),
      "totalAvailable": 300
  ], writeStrategy: .insertDefaultIfAbsent)
}
```

When we call `DittoCounter()`, the counter `orderedCount` is initialized to 0.
`totalAvailable` is a [Register](../datamodel/register) value that doesn't change unless we update it
later. 

Then, we render the seat list. We increment the counter when a user clicks
the Plus button:

`SeatFormViewController.swift`

```swift
.onPlusDidClick {
    seatDocument.update { doc in
        doc?["orderedCount"].counter?.increment(by: 1)
    }
}
```

We can also show when we've run out of the item when `orderedCount` is greater than
or equal to `totalAvailable`.


**Do not use `upsert` to increment a counter**

If we need to `upsert` the document at a later date, we do not include the counter field.
This follows our rule that the counter field should only be modified within an
`update` clause.

```swift
collection.upsert([
    "_id": docID,
    "name": "Flight ABC123",
    "totalAvailable": 400
])
```
 
### Resetting counter values

After using a counter, you may want to reset that counter back to 0. But this is
difficult because counters have no knowledge of time. A counter "remembers" all
previous increment and decrement calls. This is true even if you change the type
of a counter to another field, such as number, and then back into a counter
again again.

We recommend that you try to avoid resetting counters. Instead, try to make new
documents or collections that have meaning and encapsulate a period of time.

If you still think that you need to reset a counter field to 0, you can attempt this by
removing the counter from the document first. If another device increments the
counter at the same time that another device removes the counter, you may
encounter unexpected behavior. Proceed with caution.


```swift
let docID = try! ditto.store["drinks"].upsert([
    usedCount: DittoCounter(),
])

ditto.store["drinks"].findByID(docID).update { mutableDoc in
    mutableDoc?["usedCount"].counter?.increment(by: 11)
}

print(ditto.store["drinks"].findByID(docID)) // {usedCount: 11}

ditto.store["drinks"].findByID(docID).update { mutableDoc in
    mutableDoc?["usedCount"].counter?.increment(by: 10)
}

print(ditto.store["drinks"].findByID(docID)) // {usedCount: 21}

ditto.store["drinks"].findByID(docID).update { mutableDoc in
    mutableDoc?["usedCount"].remove()
}

let docID = try! ditto.store["drinks"].findById(docID).upsert([
    usedCount: DittoCounter(),
])

print(ditto.store["drinks"].findByID(docID)) // {usedCount: 0}

ditto.store["drinks"].findByID(docID).update { mutableDoc in
    mutableDoc?["usedCount"].counter?.increment(by: 1)
}

print(ditto.store["drinks"].findByID(docID)) // {usedCount: 1}
```
