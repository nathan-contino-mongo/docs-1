  When you install Ditto in a client device like a web, desktop, mobile,
  or IoT application, you are installing a __Small Peer__. Running on the cloud is
  a __Big Peer__. While it still looks like any peer, underneath the hood, a Big
  Peer is capable of scaling to meet the demands of large amount of data.

## Online Playground

:::caution
__DO NOT__ ship an application to production with Online Playground. We call
this a Playground because it's meant for getting started quickly without having to implement
security. We recommend that you use Online Playground in a development app (e.g., *myappname-dev*).

For using the Big Peer with an OAuth client suitable for production, use 
[Online With Authentication](../security/online-with-authentication).
:::

To get started, you can syncronize with the Ditto Big Peer using
the **Online Playground** . These apps can sync with the Big Peer if
they have the same `appID`.  Online Playground applications have __no
restrictions to data__. Online playgrounds are perfect for learning
about how to use Ditto's APIs without worrying about security architecture.

* Apps with Online Playground can read and write to all collections.
* Apps with Online Playground will connect to other peer devices or a Big Peer app with __same appID__.

### Going offline

Online Playground devices must connect to the internet first
*before* going offline. That means that any device can be offline for one week. Once the certificate has expired, the device
must re-connect to the Big Peer authentication server to refresh their certificate. Use
[OnlineWithAuthentication](../guides/authentication/intro) to specify a longer
session length and certificate expiration time.

## Get your appID

To find your **appID**, go to your app in the Ditto portal and find the __Authentication Mode & Webhook Settings__ section. Ensure that __"Playground"__ is selected like so:

## How it works

Online Playground requires that devices must first connect to the Big Peer
to create [a X.509 certificate](../how-it-works/certificate-security). This
certificate ensures that devices are allowed to syncronize with each other
either offline or online. Online Playground allows anyone to syncronize until
the certificate expires.
